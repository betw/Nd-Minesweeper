This program allows users to play the game "Minesweeper" in any number of dimensions N (Minesweeper is a logic-based puzzle game where players uncover tiles on a grid, 
aiming to avoid hidden mines while using numerical clues to determine safe spots).
In particular, the main functions allow for the creation of the game board (make_nd_board), assigning values to the board including mines and adjacent tile values (assign_values_to_board), and performing operations like revealing tiles (dig_nd) or rendering the current game state (render_nd). The game also supports recursive tile revealing and victory/defeat conditions based on whether mines are uncovered or all non-mine tiles are revealed.
